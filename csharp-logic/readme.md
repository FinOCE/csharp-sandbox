# [Add logic to your applications with C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/csharp-logic/)

Deepen your experience with C# logic and iteration statements, Boolean expressions, and code blocks in this Learning Path.

In this learning path, you'll:

* Build more complex and expressive Boolean expressions
* Use code blocks to control variable scope and the execution path of your code
* Branch the flow of code using the `switch-case` statement
* Iterate through a code block with the `for`, `while` and `do-while` statements

Once you complete this learning path, you'll have a stronger grasp of implementing logic in your C# code.

## Prerequisites

* Beginner level experience with C# concepts including declaring, initializing, and using variables
* Beginner level experience with the `if-elseif-else` statement
* Beginner level experience with arrays and the `foreach` statement
